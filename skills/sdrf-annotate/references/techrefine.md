You are guiding the user through refining SDRF technical metadata using **techsdrf** —
a CLI tool that downloads raw MS files, analyzes them with pyopenms, and auto-detects
instrument parameters, mass tolerances, PTMs, and DDA/DIA mode.

This workflow verifies and corrects technical columns that are often filled manually
from PRIDE metadata or publications, which may be incomplete or inaccurate.

## Step 1: Check Prerequisites

### 1.1 Verify techsdrf is installed
```bash
techsdrf --version
# If not installed:
pip install techsdrf
```

### 1.2 Verify raw file converters (as needed)
- **Thermo .raw files**: ThermoRawFileParser is required
  ```bash
  conda install -c bioconda thermorawfileparser
  ```
- **Bruker .d / SCIEX .wiff files**: msconvert (ProteoWizard) is required
  ```bash
  # Check availability:
  msconvert --help
  ```
  For Bruker DIA **isolation windows** specifically, no converter and no download
  are needed — `sdrf-tools bruker-dia` range-reads `analysis.tdf` out of the
  archive. See the Bruker section below.

If converters are missing, inform the user which file types cannot be processed
and suggest installation commands. techsdrf will skip files it cannot convert.

## Step 2: Choose Refinement Mode

Present the three modes and help the user choose:

### Mode A — Refine from PRIDE (recommended for PXD datasets)
Downloads raw files from PRIDE, analyzes them, and refines the SDRF.
```bash
techsdrf refine -p PXD###### -s input.sdrf.tsv -o refined.sdrf.tsv -v
```
**Use when**: The user has a PXD accession and an SDRF file to refine.

### Mode B — Refine from local files
Points to a local directory of raw files instead of downloading from PRIDE.
```bash
techsdrf refine -d /path/to/raw/files -s input.sdrf.tsv -o refined.sdrf.tsv -v
```
**Use when**: The user already has raw files locally.

### Mode C — Info only (inspect without refining)
Inspects the current SDRF technical metadata without downloading or analyzing files.
```bash
techsdrf info -s input.sdrf.tsv
```
**Use when**: The user wants a quick check of what technical metadata is declared.

## Step 3: Configure Analysis

Help the user set the right options for their analysis:

### 3.1 Number of files to analyze
- `-n 3` (default): Analyze 3 representative files — fast, usually sufficient
- `-n 5` or `-n 10`: More files for higher confidence
- `-a`: Analyze ALL files — thorough but slow; use for heterogeneous datasets
  where different files may have different instruments or acquisition methods

### 3.2 File type filter
- `-t raw`: Thermo .raw files only
- `-t d`: Bruker .d directories only
- `-t wiff` or `-t wiff2`: SCIEX files only
- If not specified, techsdrf processes all supported file types

### 3.3 Tolerance unit
- `-u ppm` (default): Report mass tolerances in parts per million
- `-u Da`: Report mass tolerances in Daltons

### 3.4 PTM detection
- By default, techsdrf performs three tiers of PTM detection
- `--skip-ptm`: Skip PTM detection (faster, use if only instrument/tolerance info needed)

### 3.5 Keep downloaded files
- `--keep-files`: Retain downloaded raw and converted mzML files after analysis
- By default, files are cleaned up to save disk space

## Step 4: Run techsdrf

### 4.1 Present the full command
Assemble the command with all chosen options and present it to the user:
```bash
techsdrf refine \
  -p PXD###### \
  -s input.sdrf.tsv \
  -n 5 \
  -o refined.sdrf.tsv \
  -v
```

### 4.2 Explain what happens
The techsdrf pipeline runs these stages:
1. **Download** — Fetches N raw files from PRIDE (or reads local files)
2. **Convert** — Converts raw files to mzML using ThermoRawFileParser or msconvert
3. **Analyze** — Parses mzML with pyopenms to extract instrument metadata, scan characteristics, and spectra
4. **Detect** — Determines instrument model, acquisition mode, fragmentation, tolerances, labels, and PTMs
5. **Compare** — Compares detected parameters against declared values in the SDRF
6. **Refine** — Produces a refined SDRF with corrected/added technical metadata

### 4.3 The user runs the command
The user executes the command in their terminal. techsdrf produces:
- Console output with detected parameters and comparison results
- A refined SDRF file (if `-o` was specified)

## Step 5: Interpret Results

Parse the techsdrf output and explain each detected parameter:

### 5.1 Instrument detection
| Detected Field | Source | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Instrument model | Raw file header | Q Exactive HF-X |
| Serial number | Raw file header | Exactive Series slot #1234 |
| Mass analyzer | Scan metadata | orbitrap |

**What to check**: Does the detected model match what's in the SDRF? PRIDE often
has generic names (e.g., "Q Exactive") while raw files have the specific model
(e.g., "Q Exactive HF-X").

### 5.2 Acquisition mode
| Detected Field | Method | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| DDA vs DIA | Spectrum analysis | `NT=Data-dependent acquisition;AC=PRIDE:0000627` |

**What to check**: Is the acquisition method in the SDRF correct? Misclassification
of DDA as DIA (or vice versa) affects which analysis pipelines can be used. Write the value in
`comment[proteomics data acquisition method]` as a descendant of `PRIDE:0000659` — DDA `PRIDE:0000627`,
DIA `PRIDE:0000450`; when techsdrf identifies a named DIA variant, prefer its specific accession
(diaPASEF `NT=diaPASEF;AC=PRIDE:0000650`, SWATH `NT=SWATH MS;AC=PRIDE:0000447`); plain DIA `PRIDE:0000450`
remains acceptable. There is no `comment[dia method]` column.

### 5.3 Fragmentation
| Detected Field | Source | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Dissociation method | MS2 scan metadata | HCD |
| Collision energy | Scan parameters | 28 NCE |

**What to check**: Does the SDRF declare the correct fragmentation method?
Multiple methods may be used (e.g., HCD + EThcD for different scans).

### 5.4 Mass tolerances
| Detected Field | Method | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Precursor tolerance | Gaussian fitting (RunAssessor) + param-medic | 10 ppm |
| Fragment tolerance | Gaussian fitting (RunAssessor) + param-medic | 20 ppm |

techsdrf uses two independent methods to estimate tolerances. Both are reported
for comparison. **What to check**: Do the detected tolerances match the SDRF?
Papers often round tolerances or report search engine settings instead of
instrument-level tolerances.

### 5.5 Labels
| Detected Field | Method | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| TMT/iTRAQ | Reporter ion detection (100-140 m/z) | TMT10plex |
| SILAC | Known mass shift patterns | not detected |

**What to check**: Does the labeling in the SDRF match what's actually in the
spectra? This catches cases where TMT is declared but the data is actually
label-free (or vice versa).

### 5.6 PTM detection (three tiers)
| Tier | Method | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1. Reporter/diagnostic ions | Known ion signatures (100-140 m/z) | TMT reporter ions |
| 2. Diagnostic ions + neutral losses | Characteristic fragment patterns | Phospho (H3PO4 loss at 97.98 Da) |
| 3. Open mass shifts | Poisson-tested mass deltas | Oxidation (+15.995 Da) |

**What to check**: Are all detected PTMs declared as `comment[modification parameters]`
in the SDRF? Are there declared modifications that were NOT detected (may indicate
incorrect annotation)?

### 5.7 Comparison summary
techsdrf reports each parameter with a status:
- **MATCH** — SDRF value matches detected value
- **MISMATCH** — SDRF value differs from detected value (flag for correction)
- **MISSING_SDRF** — Detected in raw data but not declared in SDRF (flag for addition)
- **IMPROVED** — Detected value is more specific than SDRF value (e.g., "Q Exactive" → "Q Exactive HF")

List all MISMATCH and MISSING_SDRF items with recommended fixes.

## Step 6: Apply Refinements

### 6.1 If techsdrf produced a refined SDRF file
Present the differences between original and refined SDRF:
```text
CHANGED: comment[instrument] — "Q Exactive" → "Q Exactive HF-X" (AC=MS:1002877;NT=Q Exactive HF-X)
CHANGED: comment[precursor mass tolerance] — "20 ppm" → "10 ppm"
ADDED:   comment[dissociation method] — "HCD" (was empty)
CHANGED: comment[modification parameters] col 3 — REMOVED Phospho (not detected in spectra)
```

### 6.2 Let user approve/reject each change
For each changed column:
- Show the old value and the new value
- Explain WHY techsdrf made this change (what evidence from raw data)
- Let the user approve or reject the individual change

### 6.3 If the user is working on an in-memory SDRF from `/sdrf-skills:sdrf-annotate`
Instead of a file diff, show the corrected values to paste into the SDRF:
```text
Update these technical columns based on raw file analysis:
  comment[instrument]: AC=MS:1002877;NT=Q Exactive HF-X
  comment[precursor mass tolerance]: 10 ppm
  comment[fragment mass tolerance]: 20 ppm
  comment[dissociation method]: NT=HCD;AC=MS:1000422
```

## Step 7: Post-Refinement

### 7.1 Update spec to latest version
Before validating, ensure the SDRF specification and templates are up to date:
```bash
git submodule update --remote --recursive
```
This pulls the latest column definitions (`spec/sdrf-proteomics/TERMS.tsv`) and
template versions (`spec/sdrf-proteomics/sdrf-templates/templates.yaml`).
Validation against outdated templates may miss new required columns or accept
deprecated formats.

### 7.2 Validate with sdrf-pipelines
**Always** run programmatic validation on the refined SDRF before presenting
results to the user:
```bash
parse_sdrf validate-sdrf \
  --sdrf_file refined.sdrf.tsv \
  --template <template1> \
  --template <template2>
```
Detect templates from `comment[sdrf template]` columns in the SDRF.
If `parse_sdrf` is not installed, tell the user: `pip install sdrf-pipelines`

If validation finds errors introduced by the refinement, fix them and re-run
until validation passes (or only warnings remain).

### 7.3 Contribute
If this is a ProteomeXchange dataset:
```text
Your refined SDRF has verified technical metadata from actual raw file analysis.
Run /sdrf-skills:sdrf-contribute to submit this annotation to the community repository.
```

## Bruker timsTOF: DIA windows straight from `analysis.tdf`

techsdrf needs the raw files converted; for **one** high-value table on Bruker
`.d` data it is not needed at all, and neither is the download. `analysis.tdf`
inside a `.d` archive is a plain SQLite database, and PRIDE's HTTPS mirror
serves byte ranges — so the ZIP central directory can be read from the tail and
that single member range-fetched. Measured on `PXD052416`: **14.7 MB instead of
2502 MB**, a ~170x reduction.

```bash
sdrf-tools bruker-dia "https://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/.../Blank_BK1_1_1799.d.zip"
sdrf-tools bruker-dia path/to/analysis.tdf --json     # already extracted
```

It reads `DiaFrameMsMsWindows` and reports the isolation windows, the measured
m/z coverage, the collision-energy ramp, and the instrument name from
`GlobalMetadata`. Use it whenever the deposition is timsTOF/diaPASEF and the
manuscript is vague about window placement — on PXD052416 the paper puts the
placement in a supplementary *figure*, i.e. unreadable, while the table has the
numbers.

### The isolation-window trap — read this before filling the column

`comment[isolation window width]` is a **single scalar** (`pattern:
^\d+(\.\d+)?$`, examples 25/8/4). That fits uniform SWATH-style windows.
diaPASEF windows are variable-width by design — 15 distinct widths from 29.52 to
74.51 m/z in PXD052416 — and **no single number is correct** for them.

| Situation | What to write |
|---|---|
| Every window the same width | that width |
| Widths vary (diaPASEF, typical) | `not available`, with the measured table in the report |

Never derive the value from the manuscript instead: "15 windows spanning
400–1000" → `600/15 = 40` produces a width matching **none** of the 15 actual
windows, and it passes both the regex and `parse_sdrf`. A mean or a median is
the same error with more arithmetic. `sdrf-tools bruker-dia` applies this
rule for you and prints the value it would write plus the reason.

This is a spec limitation, not an annotator failure — the column cannot express
what the instrument did (bigbio/sdrf-templates, tracked from #33). Until it can,
`not available` plus the measured table is the honest answer, and the table in
the report is what makes the value recoverable later.

## What techsdrf Detects

| Parameter | Detection Method |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Instrument model + serial | Raw file header parsing |
| DDA vs DIA | Spectrum analysis (isolation window patterns) |
| Fragmentation method (HCD/CID/ETD/EThcD) | MS2 scan metadata |
| Precursor mass tolerance | Gaussian fitting (RunAssessor) + param-medic dual estimation |
| Fragment mass tolerance | Gaussian fitting (RunAssessor) + param-medic dual estimation |
| Labels (TMT/iTRAQ) | Reporter ion detection in 100-140 m/z range |
| PTMs (phospho, glyco, etc.) | Diagnostic ions + neutral losses + open mass shifts |
| Variable modifications | Open mass-shift analysis with Poisson statistical testing |

## Important Rules

- techsdrf requires actual raw MS files — it cannot refine from metadata alone
- For Thermo .raw files, ThermoRawFileParser must be installed
- Detected parameters are empirical — they reflect what's IN the raw data, not what was intended
- If techsdrf detects a PTM not declared in the SDRF, confirm with the user before adding it (could be a biological signal or an artifact)
- If techsdrf does NOT detect a declared PTM, it may be at low abundance — do not automatically remove without user confirmation
- Always verify instrument ontology terms via OLS after techsdrf detection:
  ```text
  mcp OLS → searchClasses(query="Q Exactive HF-X", ontologyId="ms")
  ```
