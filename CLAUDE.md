# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A **skills-first** repo: the product is `skills/*/SKILL.md` — markdown workflows that teach an AI
assistant to annotate proteomics SDRF files. Supporting Python lives in `tools/`. Specification data
is **not** stored here; it is read at runtime from the `spec/` git submodule.

Skills are auto-discovered — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` carries no `skills` key, so Claude Code
scans the `skills/` directory automatically. Each SKILL.md declares its own name and routing
description in frontmatter. Currently 4: `sdrf-annotate`, `sdrf-contribute`, `sdrf-campaign` (invoked as
`/sdrf-skills:sdrf-annotate` etc. once installed as a marketplace plugin) plus `sdrf-adversarial-review`,
which `sdrf-annotate` dispatches into a fresh context at Step 9.5 and which is never typed.
`sdrf-annotate` is the one entry point for everything about one SDRF - create (review always
included), review/validate/check/score/fix an existing file, look up cell lines and terms, verify
technical metadata from raw files, plan, explain. Its `references/` hold what used to be separate
skills (setup, knowledge, templates, validate, fix, techrefine, cellline, review, design).
Run `ls skills/` for the current set — **do not trust a hardcoded skill count anywhere in this repo**;
README.md alone carries three contradictory numbers, and commit `d5c4c70` exists only to repair drift.

# Submodule: TWO levels deep (spec/ -> spec/sdrf-proteomics/sdrf-templates).
# `--recursive` is mandatory or templates.yaml is silently MISSING.
git submodule update --init --recursive     # restore pinned state (what you usually want)
git submodule update --remote --recursive   # advance to upstream tip; leaves a dirty gitlink

# tools CLI: `sdrf-tools` console script after `pip install -e .`; `python -m tools` also works from the repo root

```

`python` is an alias to `python3` here, not a binary — skills invoke bare `python`, assuming an
activated env. Supported: Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 (CI matrix); `environment.yml` pins only
`python>=3.10` with no upper bound. **conda is not installed on this machine**, so the README's
"recommended" conda path does not work here; `uv` is available and `requirements.txt` already assumes it.

## Architecture

**Three layers, loosely coupled — the coupling gaps matter more than the layers:**

1. `skills/` — 4 SKILL.md workflows. `sdrf-annotate` is a ~3.7k-word core plus seventeen `references/`
   files it reads on demand (gathering, sample and technical values, templates, validation, fix
   patterns, cellline, techrefine, review checks, reconcile, format rules, explaining, OLS lookup,
   setup, planning);
   `references/format-rules.md` is the single canonical copy of the format rules; the two review-gate skills ship `references/review-contract.md` and
   `agents/openai.yaml`. A SKILL.md is resident every turn once invoked, so its length is a per-turn
   cost - keep cores short and put detail in `references/`.
2. `tools/` — offline-first Python. `contract` and `build` are what `sdrf-annotate` runs (Steps 3
   and 6: the column contract of a template union, and the deterministic SDRF expander from
   `samples.tsv` + `technical.tsv`); `massive-files` (annotate, review) and `cellline lookup`
   (annotate) are the other helpers a skill calls. `check`, `score`, `fix`, `benchmark`, and `verify` are called
   by **no skill** — reachable only by hand or from CI, which smoke-tests all subcommands.
   `massive-files` asks MassIVE's PROXI record for the dataset's FTP root and tries it first
   (`proxi_ftp_url`): a bare MSV yielded no root at all, and the ProteomeCentral route yields one with
   the version directory missing, so both fell through to guessing `/v02/` and timed out on the many
   datasets that live under `/v01/`. `fetch_json` honours the response charset for the same
   ISO-8859-1 reason as the MCP client.
3. `spec/` — the runtime data contract (below).

**Skill dependency graph.** `sdrf-annotate` is the hub: it calls `cellline` and `techrefine` while
annotating, ends every annotation with a fresh-context `sdrf-adversarial-review` (Step 9.5: manifest,
track, dispatch, repair, re-review, gate), and in review mode does what `sdrf-review` and
`sdrf-annotate-reviewed` used to. `sdrf-campaign` screens a class of studies and loops `annotate` over the included ones. `contribute` runs `sdrf-tools review-gate gate` before publishing. `sdrf-tools doctor` replaces `setup`; validate, fix, knowledge, techrefine and cellline are
references and tool commands now. Removed 2026-09-23: `sdrf-review`, `sdrf-annotate-reviewed`, `sdrf-design` (folded into
annotate's review mode and `references/review-checks.md`), `sdrf-templates` (now
`sdrf-annotate/references/templates.md`), `sdrf-convert` (a README block). None of this routing is covered by CI
(`tools-tests.yml` ignores `skills/**`).

**Bundled paths resolve against the plugin root, not the cwd.** The spec references in `skills/`
are still written bare (`spec/sdrf-proteomics/TERMS.tsv`), so every skill that reads one opens with a
**Bundle paths** blockquote telling the agent to resolve them against `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` and to
run the helpers as `sdrf-tools …`. On the Python side,
`resolve_terms_tsv()` finds the bundled `TERMS.tsv` from `__file__` before falling back to a
cwd-relative path. Keep both when adding a skill: installed as a plugin, the cwd is the user's
project, and a cwd-relative read silently misses (degrading to the hardcoded fallback map).

### Frontmatter schema (uniform across the 14 domain skills — match it exactly)

```yaml
---
name: sdrf-annotate           # matches the directory (skills/sdrf-annotate/); invoked as /sdrf-skills:sdrf-annotate once installed as a marketplace plugin
description: Use when the user wants to ... Triggers on ...   # always starts "Use when the user"
user-invocable: true
argument-hint: "[PXD accession or experiment description]"
---
```

No skill uses `allowed-tools`, `model`, or `version`. The two review-gate skills are the exception to
the schema above: they declare only `name` + `description` and are **not** `user-invocable` — they are
dispatched by other skills into a fresh context, never typed as a slash command.

### Adding/renaming a skill: the 6-file lockstep

Nothing in CI or the tests checks this, which is why the copies have already rotted. Update **all** of:
`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` (badge, prose, table, tree), `GEMINI.md`, `.opencode/AGENTS.md`,
`.cursor/rules/sdrf-skills.mdc`, `.codex/INSTALL.md`. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` needs **no** edit —
it points at the directory.

Domain policy (value encoding, reserved words, modification syntax, UNIMOD swaps, label types, row
identity) exists once, in `skills/sdrf-annotate/references/format-rules.md`; `sdrf-annotate` and
`sdrf-annotate`'s core and references point to it. Do not paste rules back into a skill. The plasma heuristic is still ~40
near-identical lines in both `sdrf-annotate/references/gather-context.md` and `sdrf-campaign`.

## MCP

`.mcp.json` wires the bundled `mcp/server.py` (FastMCP, name `sdrf-pride-pmc`), launched via
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/.venv/bin/python`. The entry **must** carry `"type": "stdio"`: without it
Claude Code never resolves `command` and tries to exec a binary literally named `stdio`, failing with
`ENOENT: no such file or directory, posix_spawn 'stdio'`. It exposes 11 tools: `search_projects`, `search_extensive`,
`get_project_details`, `get_project_files`, `get_article_metadata`, `get_pdf_by_unpaywall`, `search`,
`searchClasses`, `getChildren`, `get_full_text_article`, `get_full_text_section`. `fastmcp`/`httpx` are in `requirements.txt` and
`environment.yml`. **The server depends on `.venv/` existing** next to the plugin
(`uv venv "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/.venv" && uv pip install --python "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/.venv/bin/python"
-r "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/requirements.txt"`) — a marketplace install ships no venv, and a plugin
upgrade replaces the directory, so it has to be re-created. Conda users repoint `command`.

Skills still call **five tools that exist in no bundled server** — `searchClassesWithEmbeddingModel`,
`listEmbeddingModels`, `searchWithEmbeddingModel` (in `sdrf-annotate` and its references, formerly `sdrf-knowledge`), and
`search_articles` / `search_preprints` (in `sdrf-annotate`). Those paths need an external OLS/PubMed/
bioRxiv MCP or a rewrite onto `searchClasses`/`getChildren`.

**`search_projects` is one page; `search_extensive` is the whole sweep.** The latter takes a LIST of
keywords, pages each to a short page, unions and dedupes on `all_accessions`, and reports what each
keyword contributed (`per_keyword.new` = 0 means that keyword was redundant). PRIDE ANDs the terms in
a keyword and then RANKS rather than filters, so recall — not pagination — is the binding limit: a
16-keyword single-cell sweep unions to more datasets than `single-cell proteomics` returns alone
(measured today: `nanoPOTS` 11 + `proteoCHIP` 11 = 22 unique, zero overlap). Exhaustion is proven
ONLY by a short page; an empty page after a full one is ambiguous, so it triggers a year-partitioned
(`filter=submissionDate==YYYY`) retry and anything still unresolved lands in `truncated` rather than
being reported as complete. PRIDE's historical bare-keyword 100-cap (#28) no longer reproduces —
verified 2026-08-19, v2 and v3 both paginate — which is why the partitioning is a detector, not an
unconditional workaround.

**Article identifiers must be BARE — silent-corruption class.** `get_article_metadata` and
`get_pdf_by_unpaywall` classify with `_classify_article_id` / `_parse_identifier`, which accept a bare
PMID (`35695565`), `PMC…`, or a bare DOI matching `^10\.\d{4,9}/…`. A prefixed `PMID:35695565` or
`doi:10.…` is rejected and yields an **error record, not an exception** — so a skill that documents the
prefixed form degrades every lookup to "no evidence" and reports it as low confidence. Pinned by
`tests/test_mcp_pride.py`.

**`get_project_details` / `search_projects` span PRIDE *and* MassIVE.** `MSV…` routes to MassIVE's
PROXI API; `PXD…` tries PRIDE then falls back to MassIVE, because MassIVE-hosted ProteomeXchange
datasets **404 in PRIDE** (`PXD003626` is a live example) — a PXD prefix is not evidence of PRIDE
residency. Results carry `repository` and `all_accessions` (a dataset may hold both an MSV and a PXD;
dedupe on it). MassIVE metadata is far thinner — measured over 100 datasets each: instruments
PRIDE 100% / MassIVE 3%, `experiment_types` and `quantification_methods` never published by MassIVE
(PRIDE 100% / 14%). Screen MassIVE candidates from the publication; empty ≠ excluded.

**PROXI parsing has three traps, all silent** — payload is in `value` not `name`; species /
publications / contacts nest one list deeper; and a missing value is often the literal string
`"null"`. `_proxi_values()` is the single place all three are handled — do not hand-roll PROXI parsing
elsewhere.

**MassIVE serves `charset=ISO-8859-1`.** `httpx.Response.json()` decodes raw bytes as UTF-8, so one
accented character (author names, European affiliations) raised `UnicodeDecodeError` and silently
dropped a whole result page — 29% recall loss on a measured query. `_cached_get_json` now falls back
to `json.loads(resp.text)`, which honours the declared charset. It also takes `not_found_ok=True` to
map a 404 to `[]`, because MassIVE 404s when you page past the end and that is exhaustion, not failure.

**PRIDE keyword search ANDs its terms.** `search_projects(keyword=…)` narrows hard on multi-word input
(`metaproteomics` → 100+, `human gut metaproteomics` → 2). Issue several short keywords and union the
accessions. PRIDE hits return the structured fields as **plain strings**, where `get_project_details`
returns **CvParam dicts** for the same logical fields; `_names()` handles both. On MassIVE's PROXI,
`resultType` is required, `pageNumber` is 1-based, and **`keywords=` is silently ignored** — it returns
the unfiltered listing, so only `search=` actually filters.

## Spec data contract (`spec/`, read at runtime — never hardcode)

- **Columns**: `spec/sdrf-proteomics/TERMS.tsv`
- **Manifest**: `spec/sdrf-proteomics/sdrf-templates/templates.yaml`
- **Templates**: `spec/sdrf-proteomics/sdrf-templates/{name}/{version}/{name}.yaml`

**TERMS.tsv is a glossary, not a column index.** 223 rows vs 345 distinct template columns, overlapping
only 204. For "is this column valid for template X?", **the resolved template YAML is authoritative**.
9 tab-separated columns (`term/type/ontology_term_accession/usage/values/description/allow_not_available/allow_not_applicable/allow_pooled`),
**CRLF-terminated** with one blank row — parse with
`csv.DictReader(open(p, newline='', encoding='utf-8-sig'), delimiter='\t')` and filter empty terms, or
`allow_pooled == 'false'` fails against `'false\r'`. Header is `type[term]`
(`characteristics[organism]`) **except** `type == 'anchor column'` (source name, assay name,
technology type), which is the bare term — `anchor column[source name]` is invalid SDRF.

**The `values` field drives ontology routing, but it is prose, not a closed grammar.** Common shapes:
comma-separated prefixes in preference order (`disease` → `MONDO, EFO, DOID, PATO`) → OLS;
`fixed: a, b, c` → closed enum, **no** OLS call; `pattern:`/`integer`/`numeric`/`free text` → no OLS;
prefix + subtree restriction (`MS, PRIDE (children of MS:1000044)`). **~26 of 223 rows fit none of
these** — do not write a parser that assumes total coverage, and never split on `,` without handling
the parenthetical, or you get the bogus ontology `PRIDE (children of MS:1000044)`.

**Templates**: `mutually_exclusive_with` appears **0 times** in `templates.yaml` — exclusivity lives in
the individual YAMLs and the graph is **asymmetric**, so compute the symmetric closure or you will
propose `human` + `plants`. Only `ms-proteomics`, `affinity-proteomics`, and `ms-metabolomics` are
`usable_alone: true`; `base` and `sample-metadata` are construction artifacts — never offer them.
`excludes` is **inert**: `resolve_templates.py` surfaces it as metadata only, and `merge_columns` never
consults it. The version in `extends: sample-metadata@>=1.0.0` is likewise decorative — the resolver
splits on `@` and always loads `latest`. Read `spec/scripts/resolve_templates.py` rather than
reimplementing merge semantics.

## SDRF invariants (silent-corruption class — wrong output, no exception)

1. **NEVER guess ontology accessions** — always verify via OLS. This is *not* self-enforcing: only
   `annotate` and `cellline` state it about accessions specifically, and `knowledge` — despite being
   the "background" skill — contains no such language at all. This file is the only global home for it.
2. **UNIMOD:1 = Acetyl, UNIMOD:21 = Phospho** — the #1 swap. `tools/column_ontology_map.py`'s
   `UNIMOD_KNOWN` is what detects these; every row in it was verified against OLS on 2026-09-21
   (issue #73 found 8 wrong rows, including `UNIMOD:374` → `Propionamide`, which made `check`
   *endorse* the error it exists to catch). Labels are unique, so `UNIMOD_BY_NAME` inverts the
   table: when NT= names a known modification, the accession is treated as the typo. **Verify any
   new row against OLS before adding it** — a wrong entry here is invisible by construction.
3. **Reserved words**: `not available` / `not applicable` — never `N/A`, `NA`, `unknown`. Gated
   per-column by TERMS.tsv's `allow_*` booleans. Exception: `sdrf-campaign`'s screening phase emits a curation TSV, not
   an SDRF, and uses **neither** reserved word — it mandates `unclear` for any undetermined `extract`
   field and `uncertain` in the `label` column (legal values: `include`/`exclude`/`uncertain`). The two
   tokens are not interchangeable, and neither belongs in an SDRF.
4. **Modification format**: `NT=name;AC=UNIMOD:id;TA=aa;MT=Fixed|Variable`. A positional value
   (`Protein N-term`) belongs in `PP=`, not `TA=`.
5. **All ontology terms carry label + accession** (e.g. "breast carcinoma" / MONDO:0007254). This file
   is the correct copy — `GEMINI.md:45`, `.cursor/rules/sdrf-skills.mdc:44`, and
   `.opencode/AGENTS.md:50` all say EFO:0000305; fix those toward this file, not the reverse.
6. **Duplicate columns are legal and load-bearing**: multiple `comment[modification parameters]` (one
   per mod) and multiple `comment[sdrf template]` (one per template) — both `cardinality: multiple`.
   `tools/sdrf_parser.py` disambiguates with `__N` keys; keying rows by raw name silently reads only
   the first occurrence.
7. **Validate before presenting any SDRF**: `parse_sdrf validate-sdrf --sdrf_file X --template Y`,
   after refreshing the submodule. Several `-t`/`--template` flags validate against the **union** of
   those templates (the `--help` says so and `tests/test_build.py` proves it on three curated
   references, 2026-09-23); the older behaviour where only the last `--template` counted
   (observed 2026-07-17 on PXD061710) is gone from current `sdrf-pipelines`. If you are on an old
   install, run once per declared template. For the authoritative multi-template
   constraint set (column licensing + reserved-word `allow_*`), resolve with
   `spec/scripts/resolve_templates.py` — parse_sdrf enforces neither. `parse_sdrf` ships in
   `sdrf-pipelines` and is **not installed by default** (CI installs only `requests`, `pytest`,
   `fastmcp`, `httpx` — not `sdrf-pipelines[ontology]`, which is heavy) — run ``sdrf-tools doctor` (install notes: `sdrf-annotate/references/setup.md`)`. Keep
   concurrent `parse_sdrf` jobs ≤ 2.
8. **A producer must never approve its own SDRF.** For changed SDRFs, require a passing receipt from
   `sdrf-adversarial-review`; any edit invalidates the receipt and requires a fresh reviewer.
   Enforced by `sdrf-tools review-gate` (`track`, `pending`, `status`, `gate`, `approve`), which
   discovers changed artifacts from git and binds each receipt to the artifact's SHA-256, so an
   approval cannot outlive the content it describes. `gate` exits 1 while review is pending.
   Enforcement lives in the CLI, not the Stop hook, because four of the five platforms this repo
   supports cannot run Claude Code hooks at all.
9. **Vendor RAW only in `comment[data file]`** — `.raw`/`.d`/`.wiff`/`.wiff2`, never peak lists
   (`.mgf`/`.mzML`/`.mzXML`). A peak-list reference validates structurally but breaks reprocessing.
10. **Row-uniqueness coordinate**: (`source name`, `characteristics[biological replicate]`,
    `comment[technical replicate]`, `comment[fraction identifier]`) must be unique; the spec MUST-unique
    key is `source name`+`assay name`+`comment[label]`. The `sdrf-annotated-datasets` review gate rejects
    collisions, so annotate/fix/contribute must produce it.
11. **Value encoding by column type**: `characteristics[...]` = the bare ontology label (never
    `NT=;AC=`); `comment[...]` = `NT=<OLS label>;AC=<accession>`; structured characteristics
    (`spiked compound` `CT=/QY=`, `pooled sample` `SN=`) keep key-value.
12. **Acquisition method** (`comment[proteomics data acquisition method]`, required for MS) is a
    descendant of `PRIDE:0000659` — DDA `PRIDE:0000627`, DIA `PRIDE:0000450`, PRM `PRIDE:0000629`,
    SRM `PRIDE:0000630`; never `MS:1000206`/`NCIT:C161786`; `comment[dia method]` was removed.
13. **Contribution hygiene**: a `datasets/` PR adds exactly one new `{ACC}/` folder —
    `git diff --cached --name-status` must show 0 deletions/modifications to other datasets;
    unresolved datasets go to CI-exempt `sandbox/` with a `BLOCKED:` note; no AI/assistant attribution
    in public commits or PRs. Never invent sample->file/channel maps, demographics, or runs.

## Landmines

- **CI runs no tests on the product.** `tools-tests.yml` is path-filtered to `tools/**`, `tests/**`,
  `requirements.txt`. A PR touching **only** `skills/**` — the actual product — plus `hooks/`, `mcp/`,
  `plugin.json`, or docs runs **zero** tests. `check-spec.yml` has no path filter so it runs on every
  PR, but only warns when the spec is stale; it never fails the build.
- **Fixture path-filter gap**: `tests/conftest.py` reads `examples/PXD_synthetic.sdrf.tsv` and
  `tools/cellline_db.py` defaults to `data/*.tsv`, but neither `examples/**` nor `data/**` is in the CI
  filter. Editing them can break main with CI never running — run pytest locally.
- **`tests/test_services.py` mocks fail open**: it pre-seeds the private `_cache` with a key that must
  byte-for-byte equal `f"{base_url}{endpoint}|{params}"`. Any mismatch issues a **live** request to
  Cellosaurus/UniProt/EBI instead of failing. Prefer `MagicMock(spec=OLSClient)` injection, as
  `tests/test_hallucination.py` does.
- **Dead code**: `tools/services.py` is imported only by its own test; `hooks/check-deps.sh` is dead —
  `hooks/hooks.json` inlines the same logic, so both must be edited in lockstep.
- `tools/sdrf_fixer.py` implements **7** fix patterns, not the 10 its own docstring and the README
  claim (comments number them 1,3,4,5,6,7,9).
