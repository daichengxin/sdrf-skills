# Single-Cell Proteomics (SCP) — Screening Criteria

Screen PRIDE studies for **MS-based single-cell proteomics**, to shortlist datasets
for downstream SDRF annotation via `sdrf:autoresearch`.

## Inclusion rules

A study is `include` when **all** of the following hold:

1. **MS-based bottom-up proteomics.** The proteome is measured by mass spectrometry.
2. **Individual cells are the unit of measurement.** Single cells are physically
   isolated and acquired as distinct samples/runs — each quantitative observation
   traces to one identified cell.
3. **Raw MS files are deposited** for the single-cell runs (not only search results
   or processed matrices).

Recognised SCP methods (any one satisfies rule 2 when per-cell isolation is stated):
nanoPOTS / nanoPOTS-DIA, SCoPE-MS, SCoPE2, pSCoPE, plexDIA / mTRAQ,
CellenONE / proteoCHIP, cellenChip, N2 / OAD chip, microfluidic or FACS
one-cell-per-well sorting, laser-capture of single cells, iBASIL, T-SCP, SciProChip.

## Exclusion rules

Mark `exclude` when any of these clearly applies, and name the decisive rule:

1. **Bulk proteomics** — many cells lysed together as one sample.
2. **Low-input but not single-cell** — sorted populations, tissue punches, or
   defined-N inputs (10/100/500 cells) with no single-cell condition. Note: many
   SCP papers include low-input *benchmarking* alongside true single cells — such a
   study is `include`, since the single-cell condition exists.
3. **Dilution mimics only** — bulk digest diluted to "single-cell-equivalent" load
   with no real cells isolated. This is a method-development artifact, not SCP.
4. **Not MS-based** — CyTOF, flow/mass cytometry, antibody arrays, Olink, CODEX.
5. **Single-cell transcriptomics only** — scRNA-seq with no single-cell proteome.
6. **Non-proteome MS** — metabolomics or lipidomics only.

## Uncertainty rule

Use `uncertain` — never guess — when the evidence cannot settle inclusion, e.g.:
- The abstract says "single-cell" but no full text is available to confirm real
  per-cell isolation rather than single-cell-equivalent loading.
- Cell counts per run are never stated.
- The PRIDE record is a partial/umbrella submission and the SCP portion is unclear.

State specifically what evidence was missing.

## Fields to extract

Fill each field from PRIDE metadata or the publication. Use `unclear` if unsupported
by evidence. Keep values short and analysis-ready.

- `organism` — scientific name as reported (e.g. `Homo sapiens`, `Mus musculus`).
  Do NOT map to an NCBITaxon accession here; that happens during annotation.
- `cell_type` — cell line or primary cell type (e.g. `HeLa`, `U-937`, `CD4+ T cell`).
  Prefer the cell line name verbatim; `/sdrf-skills:sdrf-cellline` resolves Cellosaurus later.
- `isolation_method` — how single cells were isolated (`CellenONE`, `FACS`,
  `nanoPOTS`, `laser capture`, `microfluidic`, `manual picking`).
- `scp_method` — the named method/platform (`SCoPE2`, `plexDIA`, `nanoPOTS-DIA`, ...).
- `n_single_cells` — approximate number of single cells measured, as an integer if
  stated (`~1500`), else `unclear`. This drives the SDRF row count.
- `labelling` — `label free`, `TMT`, `TMTpro`, `mTRAQ`. Isobaric labelling implies
  multiplexed channels, which changes the SDRF row formula.
- `carrier_channel` — `yes` / `no` / `unclear`. Whether a booster/carrier proteome
  channel is used (characteristic of SCoPE-MS/SCoPE2). Load-bearing: the carrier is
  a distinct sample in SDRF and is a classic annotation error when omitted.
- `channel_map` — `yes` / `no` / `label free` / `unclear`. Whether the deposited
  evidence records **which label channel of which run held which sample**. This is
  the annotatability gate for multiplexed studies: without it an SDRF needs one row
  per (file × channel) and every one of those rows would have a fabricated identity.
  - `label free` when `labelling` is `label free` — file→cell is 1:1 and the
    question does not arise. (Not `not applicable`: that is an SDRF reserved word
    and this is not an SDRF.)
  - `yes` when a real map exists — a deposited sample sheet, per-channel sample
    names in the result tables, an explicit channel table in the paper or SI, or
    layout files in an external repository cited in Data Availability (Zenodo,
    figshare, OSF, Dryad, GitHub).
  - `no` when those are exhausted and every channel carries a placeholder.
    Proteome Discoverer's `"Sample, n/a"` per channel, `StudyInformation.txt`'s
    bare `"Sample"` with empty groups, and SpectroMine's equivalent are the
    reliable, greppable tells — they look like data and are not.
  - `unclear` when the sources have not been checked, rather than checked and empty.
  A `no` does **not** change `label`: the study is still SCP and still `include`.
- `acquisition` — `DDA`, `DIA`, or both. Determines the acquisition-method template.
- `instrument` — instrument as reported (e.g. `Orbitrap Eclipse`, `timsTOF SCP`).
  Verbatim; OLS/MS-ontology mapping happens during annotation.
- `has_sdrf` — `yes` / `no`. Whether the PRIDE record already ships an `.sdrf.tsv`.
  Studies that already have one are lower priority for annotation.
- `publication` — `PMID:########` or `doi:10.xxxx/...`; `unclear` if none.

## Notes

- Prefer full-text Methods over abstract/title. Title/keyword matches alone are
  weak evidence for `include` — prefer `uncertain`.
- SCP is a young field: most datasets are post-2019. Do not exclude on date alone.
- `carrier_channel` and `n_single_cells` are the two fields most often wrong when
  inferred from the abstract. Take them from Methods or mark `unclear`.
- **Relevance and annotatability are different questions.** A study can be
  unambiguously SCP and still impossible to turn into a correct SDRF, because the
  deposited data never records which channel held which cell. `channel_map` carries
  that; the inclusion rules do not. PXD043473 ("Toward Single Bacterium Proteomics",
  PMID:37713396) is the reference case: a correct `include` — FACS-sorted single
  *E. coli* with a 250-cell carrier — whose 16 files × 10 channels are
  unannotatable, because the Methods give the run composition (3 single + 3 double
  + 2 carrier + 2 unused) but never the channel assignment, both Percolator result
  tables name all 11 channels `"Sample, n/a"`, the PRIDE file list holds no sample
  sheet, and the Europe PMC supplementary is 8 figures. Screening it as
  `channel_map=no` up front saves a full PRIDE + full-text + result-table round
  trip in annotation before the same blocker surfaces.
- `carrier_channel=yes` is a strong prompt to check `channel_map`: the carrier is
  itself a channel, so "which channel is the carrier" has to be answerable too.
